4.1.1    extend the functionality of the Software or any other software produced by the Licensor; or

and "Burp App" or "BApp" means an Extension adopted by the Licensor pursuant to this clause.

4.2       "Burp Extender API" means the official Burp Extender application programming interface available as part of the Documentation.

4.3       Extensions may be created for the use of the Licensee Provided that if any such Extension is published (which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall include sharing such Extension with another Licensee or a third party unless the party to which the Extension is provided is either a client of the Licensee and the relevant Extension has been created for use on an engagement for that or another client of the Licensee, or another Licensee within your organisation) the Licensee shall notify the Licensor and provide to it a copy of such Extension and the Licensee agrees that any such Extension shall, at the option of the Licensor, become either

4.3.1    a Burp App; or

4.3.2    part of the Software.

4.4       When the creation of an Extension is notified to the Licensor or shared publicly and comes to the attention of the Licensor the Licensor has the option to make the Extension a Burp App (Burp App, or BApp) after having carried out the necessary checks to ensure that the Extension is efficacious and suitable for use with the Software.

4.5       The Licensor has established the BApp Store product feature where Burp Apps are described and may be downloaded without charge for use as an Extension.

4.6       By designating an Extension a Burp App the Licensor warrants that the Extension has been checked by the Licensor and has been deemed suitable for use with the Software.

4.7       All Extensions and Burp Apps remain the property of the author but by creating such Extension, the author has granted an irrevocable perpetual licence free of charge to the Licensor to incorporate such Extension in the Software at the Licensor's option and an irrevocable perpetual licence free of charge to all Licensees who download the Burp App from the BApp Store.

4.8       If, at the sole option of the Licensor, the Licensor incorporates an Extension into the Software a notice will be placed on the BApp Store to that effect.

4.9    The Licensor retains the right without incurring any liability to the Licensee to disable without notice any Burp App being used by the Licensee where the Licensor considers in its sole discretion that use of such Burp App with the Software is problematical.

5.    INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS

5.1    You acknowledge that all intellectual property rights in the Software and the Documentation anywhere in the world belong to the Licensor, that rights in the Software are licensed (not sold) to you, and that you have no rights in, or to, the Software or the Documentation other than the right to use them in accordance with the terms of this Licence.

5.2    You acknowledge that you have no right to have access to the Software in source code form

5.3    The integrity of this Software is protected by technical protection measures (TPM) so that the intellectual property rights, including copyright, in the Software of the Licensor are not misappropriated. You must not attempt in any way to remove or circumvent any such TPM, nor apply or manufacture for sale or hire, import, distribute, sell or let for hire, offer or expose for sale or hire, advertise for sale or hire or have in your possession for private or commercial purposes any means the sole intended purpose of which is to facilitate the unauthorised removal or circumvention of such TPM.

6.    LICENSOR'S WARRANTY

6.1    The Licensor warrants that for a period of 90 days from the download of the Software (Warranty Period) the Software will, when properly used, perform substantially in accordance with the functions described in the Documentation (provided that the Software is properly used on the computer and with the runtime environment for which it was designed as referred to herein). Burp Apps do not have the benefit of this warranty.

6.2    You acknowledge that the Software and the Burp Apps have not been developed to meet your individual requirements, and that it is therefore your responsibility to ensure that the facilities and functions of the Software as described in the Documentation and the facilities and functions of any Burp App meet your requirements.

6.3    You acknowledge that the Software and the Burp Apps may not be free of bugs or errors, and agree that the existence of minor errors shall not constitute a breach of this Licence.

6.4    If, within the Warranty Period, you notify the Licensor in writing of any defect or fault in the Software in consequence of which it fails to perform substantially in accordance with the Documentation, and such defect or fault does not result from you having amended the Software or used it in contravention of the terms of this Licence, the Licensor will, at its sole option, either repair or replace the Software, provided that you make available all the information that may be necessary to help the Licensor to remedy the defect or fault, including sufficient information to enable the Licensor to recreate the defect or fault.
