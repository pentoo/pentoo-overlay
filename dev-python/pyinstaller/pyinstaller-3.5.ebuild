#FIXME: Interestingly, PyInstaller itself has no hard or soft dependencies
#excluding the expected build-time dependency of "setuptools". Its unit tests,
#however, require an elaborate set of pure-Python packages, C-based Python
#extensions, and system-wide shared libraries. It's fairly extreme --
#sufficiently extreme, in fact, that we do *NOT* currently bother. For an
#exhaustive list of such dependencies, see "tests/test-requirements.txt".
